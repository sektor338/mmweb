            I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't
            have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long
            career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the
            end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will
            find you, and I will kill you.
